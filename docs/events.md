# Events

Everything an app receives from the gateway, whether over the WebSocket, from the paged
`GET /v1/events` endpoint or in a webhook, is an **event** in the format defined here.

The format is the gateway's own. The gateway speaks to Telegram through **TDLib**, Telegram's
official client library, but TDLib's JSON never crosses the API, so a TDLib upgrade does not
change what an app receives.

In this document "you" are the developer of an **app**, a program that consumes the gateway.
**The user** is the person who runs the gateway and whose Telegram account it is signed in
to. Example accounts, handles, chat IDs, and message content are fictional.

How events are fetched is in [api.md](api.md#events). Which events an app may see is in
[grants.md](grants.md).

## Envelope

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "seq": 4810,
  "type": "message.new",
  "occurred_at": "2026-09-29T14:03:07Z",
  "recorded_at": "2026-09-29T14:03:07.412Z",
  "chat": { "id": "-1001234567890", "type": "channel", "title": "Acme Product Updates", "username": "acmeupdates" },
  "message": { … }
}
```

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `v` | number | Format version. `1` throughout this document. See [Versioning](#versioning). |
| `seq` | number | **Sequence number**: the event's position in the gateway's log. Positive, strictly increasing, never reused. An app sees gaps, where events for chats outside its grant are skipped, but never a change of order. It is your cursor and your deduplication key. |
| `type` | string | One of the [event types](#event-types). Ignore types you do not know. |
| `occurred_at` | timestamp | When the thing happened. Telegram's own time where Telegram gives one (the message date, the edit date); otherwise the time the gateway learned of it. |
| `recorded_at` | timestamp | When the gateway appended the event to its log. `recorded_at - occurred_at` is the delivery lag. It can be hours after the Mac was asleep or offline, because the gateway fetches what it missed when it reconnects ([architecture.md](architecture.md#delivery-guarantees)). |
| `chat` | object | The chat the event belongs to, as a [chat summary](#chat-summary). Present on every event. In `chat.updated` it is the full chat object instead. |
| payload | | One or two further fields that depend on `type`, listed in the table below. |

Timestamps are RFC 3339 in UTC ([api.md](api.md#timestamps)). Ids are strings
([api.md](api.md#identifiers-are-strings)).

---

## Event types

| Type | Payload fields | Emitted when | Scope needed |
|---|---|---|---|
| `message.new` | `message` | A message arrives in a monitored chat, including messages the user sends themselves (`is_outgoing: true`), and for each message the gateway finds when catching up after being offline. | `messages:read` |
| `message.edited` | `message` | A message's text, caption or media is edited. The full message is sent, not a difference. | `messages:read` |
| `message.deleted` | `message_ids` | Messages are deleted for everyone. | `messages:read` |
| `chat.updated` | `chat` (full), `changes` | The chat's title, username, photo or member count changes. | `chats:read` |
| `monitoring.started` | `monitoring` | The chat enters the monitored set. | `chats:read` |
| `monitoring.stopped` | `monitoring` | The chat leaves the monitored set. | `chats:read` |

An app whose grant lacks `chats:read` never receives `chat.updated` or `monitoring.*`. It can
still call `GET /v1/me` to read its `effective_chat_ids`.

### `message.new`

A text message in a group:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "seq": 4810,
  "type": "message.new",
  "occurred_at": "2026-09-29T14:03:07Z",
  "recorded_at": "2026-09-29T14:03:07.412Z",
  "chat": { "id": "-1001987654321", "type": "supergroup", "title": "Acme Support", "username": null },
  "message": {
    "id": "1523",
    "chat_id": "-1001987654321",
    "sender": { "type": "user", "id": "123456789", "display_name": "Grace Hopper", "username": "gracehopper", "is_bot": false },
    "date": "2026-09-29T14:03:07Z",
    "edit_date": null,
    "is_outgoing": false,
    "text": "@acmebot the export in v2.3 fails on large files, see https://acme.example.com/issues/812 #bug",
    "entities": [
      { "type": "mention", "offset": 0, "length": 8 },
      { "type": "url", "offset": 54, "length": 35 },
      { "type": "hashtag", "offset": 90, "length": 4 }
    ],
    "reply_to": { "chat_id": "-1001987654321", "message_id": "1519" },
    "forward_from": null,
    "media": [],
    "media_group_id": null,
    "link": null,
    "raw_content_type": "messageText"
  }
}
```

A channel post with a photo and a caption:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "seq": 4811,
  "type": "message.new",
  "occurred_at": "2026-09-29T14:03:20Z",
  "recorded_at": "2026-09-29T14:03:20.088Z",
  "chat": { "id": "-1001234567890", "type": "channel", "title": "Acme Product Updates", "username": "acmeupdates" },
  "message": {
    "id": "412",
    "chat_id": "-1001234567890",
    "sender": { "type": "chat", "id": "-1001234567890", "display_name": "Acme Product Updates", "username": "acmeupdates" },
    "date": "2026-09-29T14:03:20Z",
    "edit_date": null,
    "is_outgoing": false,
    "text": "v2.4 is out. Release notes: https://acme.example.com/releases/2.4",
    "entities": [ { "type": "url", "offset": 28, "length": 37 } ],
    "reply_to": null,
    "forward_from": null,
    "media": [
      {
        "media_id": "med_3fK9pQ2mR7tV1wX5yZ8aB4cD6eF0gH2j",
        "kind": "photo",
        "mime": "image/jpeg",
        "size": 184320,
        "width": 1280,
        "height": 720,
        "duration_seconds": null,
        "file_name": null
      }
    ],
    "media_group_id": null,
    "link": "https://t.me/acmeupdates/412",
    "raw_content_type": "messagePhoto"
  }
}
```

### `message.edited`

The payload is the same as for `message.new`, with `edit_date` set; `occurred_at` equals it.

- Telegram does not say what changed. Compare with what you stored.
- There is one event per edit. Telegram announces an edit in two notifications; the gateway
  emits once per chat, message and `edit_date`.
- A content change that Telegram does not stamp with an edit date is not an edit and produces
  no event. Examples: votes on a poll, a link preview finishing loading.
- Edits of messages sent before the chat was monitored are delivered too. You may receive
  `message.edited` for an id you have never seen: treat it as an upsert.

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "seq": 4812,
  "type": "message.edited",
  "occurred_at": "2026-09-29T14:05:02Z",
  "recorded_at": "2026-09-29T14:05:02.230Z",
  "chat": { "id": "-1001987654321", "type": "supergroup", "title": "Acme Support", "username": null },
  "message": {
    "id": "1523",
    "chat_id": "-1001987654321",
    "sender": { "type": "user", "id": "123456789", "display_name": "Grace Hopper", "username": "gracehopper", "is_bot": false },
    "date": "2026-09-29T14:03:07Z",
    "edit_date": "2026-09-29T14:05:02Z",
    "is_outgoing": false,
    "text": "@acmebot the export in v2.3 fails on files over 1 GB, see https://acme.example.com/issues/812 #bug",
    "entities": [
      { "type": "mention", "offset": 0, "length": 8 },
      { "type": "url", "offset": 58, "length": 35 },
      { "type": "hashtag", "offset": 94, "length": 4 }
    ],
    "reply_to": { "chat_id": "-1001987654321", "message_id": "1519" },
    "forward_from": null,
    "media": [],
    "media_group_id": null,
    "link": null,
    "raw_content_type": "messageText"
  }
}
```

### `message.deleted`

Telegram reports deletions in batches and without content, so the payload is a list of ids.
Only deletions for everyone are emitted: a message removed from the user's own view alone, or
dropped from TDLib's local cache, produces nothing (in TDLib's terms, the event requires
`is_permanent` and not `from_cache`). The ids may refer to messages your app never received.

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "seq": 4813,
  "type": "message.deleted",
  "occurred_at": "2026-09-29T14:06:41.900Z",
  "recorded_at": "2026-09-29T14:06:41.903Z",
  "chat": { "id": "-1001987654321", "type": "supergroup", "title": "Acme Support", "username": null },
  "message_ids": ["1520", "1521"]
}
```

### `chat.updated`

`chat` is the full [chat object](api.md#the-chat-object) after the change. `changes` lists
which of `title`, `username`, `photo` and `member_count` changed. Changes to the member count
alone are coalesced to at most one `chat.updated` per chat per `05:00`.

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "seq": 4814,
  "type": "chat.updated",
  "occurred_at": "2026-09-29T14:10:00.512Z",
  "recorded_at": "2026-09-29T14:10:00.515Z",
  "chat": {
    "id": "-1001987654321",
    "type": "supergroup",
    "title": "Acme Support (official)",
    "username": null,
    "member_count": 12841,
    "is_monitored": true,
    "photo": { "media_id": "med_9aB2cD4eF6gH8jK0lM2nP4qR6sT8uV0w", "width": 640, "height": 640 }
  },
  "changes": ["title", "member_count"]
}
```

### `monitoring.started` and `monitoring.stopped`

Emitted when the user changes which chats the gateway monitors, or when the membership of a
monitored folder changes. An app receives them for the chats in its grant, so it learns when
its coverage of a chat starts and stops.

| `monitoring` field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `source` | `"chat"`: the user monitors this chat individually. `"folder"`: the chat is monitored because it is in a monitored folder. |
| `folder_id`, `folder_title` | The folder, when `source` is `"folder"`; otherwise `null`. |

`occurred_at` is the moment of the change. After `monitoring.started`, messages from that
moment on arrive as `message.new`. Earlier ones are reachable only through
[history](api.md#history).

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "seq": 4815,
  "type": "monitoring.started",
  "occurred_at": "2026-09-29T14:12:30.001Z",
  "recorded_at": "2026-09-29T14:12:30.004Z",
  "chat": { "id": "-1001555000111", "type": "channel", "title": "Industry News", "username": "industrynews" },
  "monitoring": { "source": "folder", "folder_id": "3", "folder_title": "Product" }
}
```

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "seq": 4901,
  "type": "monitoring.stopped",
  "occurred_at": "2026-09-30T08:00:00.120Z",
  "recorded_at": "2026-09-30T08:00:00.121Z",
  "chat": { "id": "-1001987654321", "type": "supergroup", "title": "Acme Support", "username": null },
  "monitoring": { "source": "chat", "folder_id": null, "folder_title": null }
}
```

---

## Chat summary

The `chat` field on `message.*` and `monitoring.*` events is a summary: enough to route and
label an event without a lookup.

```json
{ "id": "-1001234567890", "type": "channel", "title": "Acme Product Updates", "username": "acmeupdates" }
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | The chat id, Telegram's number for the chat, as a string. |
| `type` | `private`, `basic_group`, `supergroup` or `channel`. A **supergroup** is a large group in which every member can post; a **channel** is a broadcast feed in which only admins post. All four are defined in [api.md](api.md#chat-ids). |
| `title` | The chat's name. |
| `username` | The public handle without `@`, or `null` when the chat has none. |

The full chat object, with member count, photo and `is_monitored`, is in `chat.updated` and
at `GET /v1/chats` ([api.md](api.md#the-chat-object)).

---

## Message object

The same object appears in `message.new`, in `message.edited`, and in the response of
`GET /v1/chats/{chat_id}/messages`.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | The message id, unique within its chat ([api.md](api.md#message-ids)). It increases with time within a chat but is not contiguous. |
| `chat_id` | string | The chat's id, repeated from the envelope so that the object stands alone in history responses. |
| `sender` | object | Who sent it. See [Sender](#sender). |
| `date` | timestamp | When it was sent: Telegram's server time, in whole seconds. |
| `edit_date` | timestamp or null | When it was last edited. |
| `is_outgoing` | boolean | `true` when the user's own account sent it. |
| `text` | string | The message text, or the caption of a media message; `""` when there is neither. It is plain text: formatting such as bold, italic and code is stripped. |
| `entities` | array | Spans of `text` with a meaning. See [Entities](#entities). Empty when there are none. |
| `reply_to` | object or null | `{ "chat_id", "message_id" }` of the message this one replies to. It is usually in the same chat, but a reply can point into another chat (a channel's linked discussion group), hence `chat_id`. The replied-to message is not included; fetch it through history if you need it. |
| `forward_from` | object or null | Where a forwarded message came from. See [Forward origin](#forward-origin). |
| `media` | array | Zero or one [media object](#media-object). Telegram allows one file per message; an album is several messages that share a `media_group_id`. The field is an array so that more can be carried later without a breaking change. |
| `media_group_id` | string or null | Set when the message is part of an album. All messages of the album share the value and arrive as separate `message.new` events. |
| `link` | string or null | `https://t.me/<username>/<id>` when the chat has a public username, otherwise `null`. |
| `raw_content_type` | string | The name of TDLib's content type for the message: `messageText`, `messagePhoto`, `messagePoll`, `messagePinMessage` and so on, or `"unknown"` if TDLib supplied none. **This field is not stable.** It tells you what kind of message you are looking at when the gateway does not model its content. Its values follow TDLib and can change when the gateway moves to a newer TDLib. Use it for logging and counting, not for logic. |

Messages whose content the gateway does not model (polls, locations, contacts, service
messages such as "Grace joined the group") still produce a `message.new`. `text` is `""`, or
the caption if there is one; `media` is empty, or holds the sticker or file; and
`raw_content_type` names the kind. The gateway never drops a message from a monitored chat.

---

## Sender

```json
{ "type": "user", "id": "123456789", "display_name": "Grace Hopper", "username": "gracehopper", "is_bot": false }
```

```json
{ "type": "chat", "id": "-1001234567890", "display_name": "Acme Product Updates", "username": "acmeupdates" }
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `type` | `user`: a person or a bot. `chat`: a channel posting under its own name, or a group admin posting anonymously, which Telegram attributes to the group itself. |
| `id` | The user id (positive) or the chat id. |
| `display_name` | The user's first and last name joined with a space, or the chat's title. Never empty: a user whom Telegram no longer resolves is `"Deleted Account"`, with `is_bot: false`. |
| `username` | The public handle without `@`, or `null`. |
| `is_bot` | Present only when `type` is `user`. |

---

## Entities

An **entity** is a span of `text` that has a meaning. Telegram defines many kinds; the
gateway keeps the ones an app is likely to act on:

| `type` | The span is | Extra field |
|---|---|---|
| `mention` | `@username` | |
| `text_mention` | The name of a user who has no username | `user_id` |
| `hashtag` | `#tag` | |
| `cashtag` | `$TICKER` | |
| `url` | A URL written out in the text | |
| `text_link` | Text that links elsewhere; the URL is not in the text | `url` |
| `bot_command` | `/command` | |
| `email` | An e-mail address | |

Each entity has an `offset` and a `length`. Entities are sorted by `offset` and do not
overlap.

**Offsets and lengths are in UTF-16 code units.** That is how Telegram defines them, and it
is how JavaScript strings count, so `text.slice(offset, offset + length)` is correct in
JavaScript. In languages that count code points, convert first: an emoji before an entity
moves its offset by 2, not 1. In Python:

```python
def entity_text(text: str, offset: int, length: int) -> str:
    utf16 = text.encode("utf-16-le")
    return utf16[offset * 2 : (offset + length) * 2].decode("utf-16-le")
```

---

## Forward origin

```json
{ "type": "chat", "id": "-1001555000111", "display_name": "Industry News", "username": "industrynews", "message_id": "88", "date": "2026-09-28T19:20:00Z" }
```

| `type` | Forwarded from | Fields set |
|---|---|---|
| `user` | A user | `id`, `display_name`, `username`, `date` |
| `chat` | A post in a channel or group | `id`, `display_name`, `username`, `message_id` (in the origin chat), `date` |
| `hidden_user` | A user who hides their account on forwarded messages | `display_name` (the name shown), `date` |

`date` is when the original was sent. `id`, `username` and `message_id` are `null` where they
do not apply.

---

## Media object

```json
{
  "media_id": "med_3fK9pQ2mR7tV1wX5yZ8aB4cD6eF0gH2j",
  "kind": "video",
  "mime": "video/mp4",
  "size": 20971520,
  "width": 1920,
  "height": 1080,
  "duration_seconds": 42,
  "file_name": "demo.mp4"
}
```

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `media_id` | string | Opaque, and stable per Telegram file. Fetch the bytes at `GET /v1/media/{media_id}` with the `media:read` scope ([api.md](api.md#media)). |
| `kind` | string | One of the kinds below. Tolerate kinds you do not know. |
| `mime` | string or null | The MIME type, when Telegram reports one. |
| `size` | number or null | Size in bytes. `null` until Telegram reports it. For some videos Telegram reports only an expected size, and that is what is given. |
| `width`, `height` | number or null | Pixels, for photos, videos, stickers, animations and video notes; otherwise `null`. |
| `duration_seconds` | number or null | Whole seconds, for video, audio, voice, video notes and animations. |
| `file_name` | string or null | The original file name of a document, audio file or video, when the sender's Telegram app supplied one. |

| `kind` | What it is | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `photo` | A photo | The largest size Telegram offers, which is the size served. `mime` is `image/jpeg`. |
| `video` | A video | |
| `document` | A file of any type | |
| `audio` | A music or audio file | |
| `voice` | A voice note | |
| `video_note` | A round video message | `width` and `height` are both the side length. `mime` is `video/mp4`. |
| `sticker` | A sticker | `mime` follows the sticker's format: `image/webp`, `application/x-tgsticker` or `video/webm`. |
| `animation` | A silent looping clip (GIF-like) | |

The caption of a media message is the message's `text`, not a field of the media object, so
the same text-handling code serves every message.

A chat's `photo`, in the [chat object](api.md#the-chat-object), is a reduced media object:
`{ "media_id", "width", "height" }`. It is always a JPEG at Telegram's "big" size, reported as
640×640 because Telegram does not supply the dimensions of chat photos.

---

## Not supported

Format version 1 does not carry the following.

| Not included | Detail |
|---|---|
| Reactions and view counts | Emoji reactions on messages, and the view counter of channel posts. |
| Polls | A poll produces a message with `raw_content_type: "messagePoll"` and empty `text`. Its options and votes are not exposed. |
| Text formatting | Bold, italic, code, spoiler, underline and strikethrough are stripped; `text` is plain. |
| Forum topics | Messages in a supergroup with topics carry no topic id. |
| Read state, pinned flags, scheduled messages | |
| Comment threads | Nothing beyond `reply_to`. |
| Locations, contacts and service messages as structured data | They arrive as messages with empty `text` and a `raw_content_type`. |
| The user's account | Nothing about it beyond `is_outgoing`. |
| Private chats and unmonitored chats | This is not a limit of the format. They never leave the gateway ([grants.md](grants.md#what-the-gateway-guarantees)). |

Any of these can be added later as an additive change, described next.

---

## Versioning

Every event and every webhook body carries `"v": 1`. The API path (`/v1/…`) and the event
format version move together.

**Additive changes** keep `v: 1` and can appear at any time without notice:

- new fields on any object, `null` for older events where the value is unknown
- new event types
- new values of `entities[].type`, `media[].kind`, `forward_from.type` and `sender.type`
- new values of `raw_content_type`, which follow TDLib and are not part of the contract

An app must therefore ignore unknown fields, ignore unknown event types, and treat every
enumeration as open: a `switch` with a default branch that logs and continues.

**Breaking changes** bump `v` to `2` and are served only under `/v2/…`. Breaking means
removing or renaming a field, changing a field's type, changing the meaning of `seq` or
`since`, or changing the unit of entity offsets. `/v1/…` keeps serving `v: 1` events,
including events recorded after version 2 exists, for as long as version 1 is supported. A
deprecation is announced in this file with a date at least 90 days ahead. Events recorded
under version 1 stay readable under version 2, because the gateway renders events from
stored data rather than from stored JSON.

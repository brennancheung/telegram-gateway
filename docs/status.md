# Status and roadmap

Telegram Gateway is pre-release software. It builds from source, its test suite passes, and
the gateway, the menu bar app and `tgw` run together on a Mac. The part that talks to
Telegram has been written against TDLib's schema and tested with a scripted stand-in; it has
not yet been verified against a live Telegram account. Read the second section before you
rely on it.

## What works today

- **Building from source**: TDLib at a pinned commit, the Swift package (`GatewayDaemon`,
  `tgw`), and the menu bar app. See [development.md](development.md) and [app.md](app.md).
- **The gateway service**: runs in the foreground or as a LaunchAgent, keeps its data in one
  directory, refuses to run twice on the same data, shuts down cleanly.
- **The whole API in [api.md](api.md)**: health, the access-request flow, grants and scopes,
  the monitored set and folders, paged events, the WebSocket stream with resume, history,
  media with range requests, webhooks with signatures and retries, the login endpoints,
  pruning, rate limits.
- **The event log**: numbered events, resume from any sequence number, retention and pruning.
- **Webhook delivery**: ordered batches, HMAC signatures, the retry schedule, pause and
  resume, recovery of an interrupted delivery after a restart.
- **Administration** from the menu bar app and from `tgw`: install and inspect the
  LaunchAgent, change the monitored set, approve, deny and revoke, follow the event stream.
- **Tests**: the suite runs without a Telegram account and without network access, and
  covers everything above, including the translation of each TDLib update into the event
  format in [events.md](events.md).

## Not yet verified against a live Telegram account

The code on the TDLib side follows TDLib's published schema, and the tests feed it objects
built from that schema. None of the following has been observed with a real account yet, so
expect to find differences:

- Logging in through the gateway: the QR flow, phone number with code and two-step password,
  accounts that log in with an e-mail code, and logging out and in again without a restart.
- Whether Telegram pushes new messages promptly for large channels the account has joined
  but not opened recently, and whether the chat list must be loaded first.
- Edited messages: the order in which TDLib reports an edit's two updates, and that exactly
  one `message.edited` results.
- Backfill after sleep or a lost connection: reading history forward from the last message
  seen, in busy chats.
- Chat folders: reading a folder's chats, and following changes made on the phone.
- Member counts and how often Telegram reports them.
- Media: downloading on demand, progress while downloading, and eviction from the cache.
- Long-running behaviour: days of uptime, reconnects, Telegram's rate limits on history.

`tgw watch` exists to check the second item directly: it prints each message as TDLib
reports it, next to the message's own timestamp.

## Known limitations

- macOS on Apple silicon only, macOS 15 or later.
- One Telegram account per gateway.
- Read-only. The gateway cannot send messages.
- No packaged release. You build from source, which needs Xcode, cmake and a few minutes.
- You need your own `api_id` and `api_hash` from https://my.telegram.org.
- Apps on other machines can receive webhooks but cannot open the WebSocket or call the
  HTTP API: the gateway listens on `127.0.0.1` only.
- The event log stores message content unencrypted in the data directory, and keeps it
  forever unless you set a retention period or prune.
- Webhook signing secrets are stored unencrypted in the gateway's database, since the
  gateway signs with them. An approved app's token is stored unencrypted for the `10:00` in
  which the app may collect it.
- Reactions, poll contents, read state, forum topics and secret chats are not part of the
  event format.
- On the WebSocket, a bad token is reported with a close code after the upgrade, not with an
  HTTP `401`.
- A locally built menu bar app may fail to register the gateway to start at login; macOS
  reports it registered but does not start it. Installing the LaunchAgent with
  `tgw daemon install` works, as does letting the app run the gateway while it is open.
- There are two ways to run the gateway at login (the app's and `tgw daemon install`). Use
  one; a second gateway on the same data directory refuses to start.

## Planned

- Verification against a live account, and fixes for whatever differs.
- The gateway bundled inside the menu bar app, so that installing the app is the whole
  installation and no command-line step is needed.
- A signed, notarized release, with secrets in the Keychain.
- Sending messages, behind its own scope (`messages:send`) that the user grants explicitly.
- Consumers on other machines holding a WebSocket, over a private network.

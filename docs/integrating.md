# Integrating an app

This guide takes you from nothing to an app that receives every message from chosen Telegram
chats, in order, without losing or repeating any, and resumes where it stopped after a
restart.

**What you will have at the end:** a token for your app, a consumer that reads events over a
WebSocket or receives them at a webhook, a stored cursor that makes restarts lossless, and,
if you need them, past messages and media files.

**What you need first:**

- A running gateway that is signed in to Telegram, with at least one chat monitored. Setting
  one up is covered in the [README](../README.md).
- Access to the person who runs it, because they approve your app.
- For the examples here: Node 22 or Python 3.12. Any language with an HTTP client works.

In this guide "you" are the developer of an **app**, a program that consumes the gateway.
**The user** is the person who runs the gateway and whose Telegram account it is signed in
to. They may be you.

The exact contract is in [api.md](api.md) (endpoints), [events.md](events.md) (what an event
looks like) and [grants.md](grants.md) (what your app may see). This guide links into them.

Durations are written `mm:ss` (or `h:mm:ss`); values under a minute are in seconds.

## How it works

The **gateway** is a background service on the user's Mac, signed in to Telegram as the
user's own account (not a bot). It watches the chats the user chose, the **monitored chats**,
and turns each message in them into an **event** in its own JSON format. It gives every event
a **sequence number** (`seq`), an integer that only ever increases, and stores the event
before delivering it.

Your app never talks to Telegram. It talks to the gateway at

```
http://127.0.0.1:41414
```

with a **token** the user granted it. It reads events in one of two ways:

- over a **WebSocket**, a persistent connection your app opens to the gateway, or
- at a **webhook**, an HTTPS URL of yours that the gateway posts events to.

Because every event has a `seq` and the gateway keeps events, your app can crash, restart or
be offline for a week and continue exactly where it stopped, by passing back the `seq` of the
last event it processed. That number is your **cursor**.

Other terms you will meet:

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Chat** | Any Telegram conversation: a channel (a broadcast feed), a group, or a private conversation. |
| **Chat id** | Telegram's number for a chat. Always a string in this API, for example `"-1001234567890"`. |
| **Scope** | A kind of access, such as `messages:read`. |
| **Grant** | Your app's approved access: its scopes, its chats and its token. |

All of them are defined in [api.md](api.md#conventions) and [grants.md](grants.md).

Check that the gateway is up before anything else:

```
GET http://127.0.0.1:41414/v1/health
```

`"status": "ok"` means it is signed in and connected. `"degraded"` with a `tdlib.auth_state`
other than `ready` means the user has not signed in to Telegram yet: stored events can still
be read, but nothing new arrives.

---

## Request access

Choose the scopes you need from the table in [grants.md](grants.md#scopes), and ask for the
fewest that will do. Then:

```http
POST /v1/access-requests
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Community Analytics",
  "description": "Classifies messages in product channels and counts topics per day.",
  "scopes": ["messages:read", "history:read", "chats:read"],
  "requested_chats": "any"
}
```

The response contains `request_id` and `poll_url`.

- The user now sees your request in the gateway's menu bar app, with your name and
  description. Write the description for them: one sentence that says what your app does
  with the messages.
- `requested_chats` is a suggestion. If you know the chat ids you want, list them, and the
  user sees them by title. Otherwise send `"any"` and the user picks.
- Add `"webhook": { "url": "https://…" }` if you will use a webhook (see
  [Choose WebSocket or webhooks](#choose-websocket-or-webhooks)).

The API listens only on the Mac that runs the gateway. If your app runs elsewhere, make this
request and the polling below from that Mac, for example with `curl`:

```sh
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:41414/v1/access-requests \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"Community Analytics","description":"Classifies messages in product channels and counts topics per day.","scopes":["messages:read","chats:read"],"webhook":{"url":"https://analytics.example.com/tgw/events"}}'
```

---

## Poll for approval

```http
GET /v1/access-requests/{request_id}
```

Poll every 3s, and no faster than once per 2s, until `status` is no longer `pending`. A
request expires after `15:00`. If you get `expired`, create a new request.

On `approved`, the response contains:

- `token`: your app token.
- `grant`: what you were given. It may be less than you asked for, so read `grant.scopes`
  and `grant.effective_chat_ids`.
- `webhook.secret`, if you registered a webhook.

**Store `token` and `webhook.secret` immediately.** They are shown for `10:00` after
approval and never again ([Storing the token](grants.md#storing-the-token)).

From now on, every request carries:

```
Authorization: Bearer tgw_…
```

Confirm with `GET /v1/me`, which returns your grant, and with `GET /v1/chats` (needs
`chats:read`), which lists your chats by title.

---

## Choose WebSocket or webhooks

| | WebSocket (`GET /v1/events/stream`) | Webhook (the gateway posts to you) |
|---|---|---|
| Where your app runs | On the same Mac as the gateway. The API is reachable only there. | Anywhere the Mac can reach over HTTPS. |
| Who keeps the cursor | **You.** Pass `since` when connecting; store it after processing. | **The gateway.** It advances when you answer `2xx`. |
| Latency | Lowest: events are pushed as they are recorded. | Up to 500 ms of batching, plus your HTTP round trip. |
| When your app is down | Nothing happens. You replay from `since` when you are back. | The gateway retries for `24:00:00`, then pauses the webhook until it is resumed. |
| Ordering | In `seq` order per connection. | In `seq` order per grant, one delivery at a time. |
| Duplicates arise | When you reconnect before storing the cursor. | When your `2xx` is lost, and when the gateway restarts mid-delivery. |
| You build | A reconnect loop and a stored cursor. | An HTTPS endpoint, signature verification, idempotent handling. |
| Older events | Connect with an earlier `since`. | The cursor starts at the head of the log when the webhook is created. Read older events once with `GET /v1/events`, from the Mac. |
| History and media endpoints | Available. | Available only from the Mac. An app on another machine receives events, including media descriptions, but cannot call the API for past messages or file bytes. |
| Suits | Local services and command-line tools; development. | Servers elsewhere, serverless functions, anything that should not hold a socket open. |

In short: on the Mac, use the WebSocket; anywhere else, use a webhook.

Both deliver **at least once, in order**, so deduplicate on `seq` either way. One grant can
use both at once; their cursors are independent.

---

## Connect and resume with `since`

`since` is exclusive: you receive events with a `seq` **greater than** it. Store the `seq` of
the last event you fully processed. That is exactly the value to send next time.

On the first run you have no cursor. Choose one:

| You want | Connect with | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| Only new events | no `since` | The first frame is `caught_up` with the current head of the log. Store that `seq` as your cursor. |
| Everything the gateway holds | `since=0` | The backlog is streamed in order, which can take a while, and then `caught_up` follows. |
| To continue from a known point | `since=<seq>` | Events after that point, then `caught_up`. |

**Webhooks have no `since`.** The gateway starts your cursor at the head of the log when the
webhook is registered. To read older events, call `GET /v1/events?since=0&limit=1000` in a
loop, following `next_since` while `has_more` is true. Doing this before or after
registering is equally safe, because deduplicating on `seq` absorbs the overlap.

**If the events you ask for are gone.** The user can prune old events. When `since` points
below the oldest retained event you get `410 history_pruned` (HTTP), or an error frame
followed by close code `4410` (WebSocket), with `details.oldest_seq`. Record the gap, set
your cursor to `oldest_seq - 1` so that the oldest retained event is the next one you
receive, and if the gap matters, fill it from history
([Read history to backfill](#read-history-to-backfill)).

**Paged reads, for batch jobs** that do not hold a socket:

```http
GET /v1/events?since=4700&limit=1000
```

```json
{ "events": [ … ], "has_more": true, "next_since": 5700, "head_seq": 9100 }
```

Repeat with `since=<next_since>` until `has_more` is false. `head_seq - next_since` bounds
how far behind you are.

---

## Handle heartbeats and reconnect

The WebSocket carries four kinds of frame ([api.md](api.md#get-v1eventsstream-websocket)):

```json
{ "type": "event", "event": { "seq": 4810, … } }
{ "type": "caught_up", "seq": 4812 }
{ "type": "heartbeat", "seq": 4812, "time": "2026-09-29T14:03:37.001Z" }
{ "type": "error", "code": "history_pruned", "message": "…", "details": { "oldest_seq": 4000 } }
```

**Liveness.** The gateway sends a heartbeat after every 30s of silence. If no frame of any
kind arrives for `01:30`, the connection is dead: close it and reconnect with your stored
cursor as `since`.

**Backoff.** Wait 1s, then 2s, then 4s, doubling up to 30s, with random jitter. A restart
of the gateway (close code `1001`) disconnects every local app at the same moment, and
jitter keeps them from all returning at once.

**Close codes.** Most mean "reconnect". These do not:

| Code | Meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `4499` | Your grant was revoked while you were connected. | Stop, and tell a person. Only the user can restore access. |
| `4401` | The token is missing, invalid or revoked. An error frame names which. | Stop. Reconnecting cannot succeed. |
| `4403` | Your grant has neither `messages:read` nor `chats:read`. | Stop. There is nothing to stream. |
| `4400` | Your query string is invalid. An error frame says why. | Stop, and fix the request. |
| `4409` | Too many connections for this token (the limit is 4). | Stop. Your app is leaking connections. |
| `4410` | The events after your `since` were pruned. | Move your cursor to `oldest_seq - 1`, then reconnect. |

The full list is in [api.md](api.md#close-codes).

**Unknown frames and events.** Ignore frames whose `type` you do not know, and events whose
`event.type` you do not know. The format grows by addition
([events.md](events.md#versioning)).

---

## Verify webhook signatures

Every delivery carries `X-TGW-Signature: sha256=<hex>`: the HMAC-SHA256 of the **raw request
body bytes**, keyed with your webhook secret. Verify it before parsing the JSON, over the
exact bytes received rather than a re-serialisation, with a constant-time comparison. On a
mismatch, answer `401` and do not process the body.

TypeScript (Node 22, built-in `crypto`):

```ts
import { createHmac, timingSafeEqual } from "node:crypto";

export function verifyTgwSignature(rawBody: Buffer, header: string | undefined, secret: string): boolean {
  if (!header?.startsWith("sha256=")) return false;
  const expected = createHmac("sha256", secret).update(rawBody).digest();
  const given = Buffer.from(header.slice("sha256=".length), "hex");
  return given.length === expected.length && timingSafeEqual(given, expected);
}
```

Python 3.12:

```python
import hmac, hashlib

def verify_tgw_signature(raw_body: bytes, header: str | None, secret: str) -> bool:
    if not header or not header.startswith("sha256="):
        return False
    expected = hmac.new(secret.encode(), raw_body, hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()
    return hmac.compare_digest(header[len("sha256="):], expected)
```

Make sure your framework hands you the raw body. In Express, use
`express.raw({ type: "application/json" })` on that route, not `express.json()`. In FastAPI,
use `await request.body()`.

Then process the batch, `body.events`, in order, and answer `2xx` **within 10s**. If
processing can take longer, store the batch and answer `200` first: the gateway needs to know
only that you accepted it. A failed or late answer is retried on the schedule in
[api.md](api.md#retry-schedule).

To make the gateway stop sending, for maintenance or a migration, answer `410`. The webhook
pauses at once and stays paused until it is resumed with `POST /v1/me/webhook/resume` or by
the user.

---

## Deduplicate on `seq`

Both the WebSocket and webhooks deliver at least once. Every event's `seq` is unique, and
the events you receive arrive in increasing `seq`, so deduplication is one comparison:

```
if event.seq <= cursor: skip
else: process(event); cursor = event.seq; store(cursor)
```

Store the cursor **after** processing, so that a crash between the two replays the event
instead of losing it.

If processing is not idempotent, for example it increments a counter, make the two steps
atomic: write the counter and the cursor in one transaction, or key the counter by `seq` so
that a repeated write changes nothing.

`seq` is numbered across the whole gateway, so your app sees gaps. A gap is not a lost event.
Only a `seq` you have already processed arriving again is a duplicate.

---

## Read history to backfill

Events begin when the user started monitoring a chat. For anything earlier, such as last
quarter's messages for an analytics baseline, use history. It reads the chat's timeline from
Telegram itself and needs the `history:read` scope.

```http
GET /v1/chats/-1001234567890/messages?limit=100
```

This returns the 100 newest messages, newest first, each in the same
[message object](events.md#message-object) shape as in `message.new`, together with
`next_before`. To walk backwards:

```
before = None
while True:
    page = GET /v1/chats/{id}/messages?limit=100[&before=before]
    for m in page.messages: upsert(m)      # keyed by (chat_id, id)
    if not page.has_more: break
    before = page.next_before
    # stay under 60 requests per minute
```

- Stop when you reach the date you care about. `has_more` is true whenever a full page came
  back, so the very last request may return an empty page.
- Key your storage by `(chat_id, message.id)`, not by `seq`: history has no `seq`. Let
  `message.new` and `message.edited` events upsert into the same table, and the two sources
  merge cleanly.
- Backfill once per chat and record that you did. Do it again for a chat when you receive
  `monitoring.started` for it.

---

## Fetch media

If a message has media, `media[0].media_id` identifies the file. With the `media:read`
scope:

```http
GET /v1/media/med_3fK9pQ2mR7tV1wX5yZ8aB4cD6eF0gH2j
```

| Response | Meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `200` | The bytes, with `Content-Type` and `Content-Disposition`. | Store them under your own key. The response is immutable, so you never need the same `media_id` twice. |
| `202` with `Retry-After: 5` | The gateway is still downloading the file from Telegram. | Wait and request again. Each request waits up to 30s while the download runs. |
| `410 media_gone` | Telegram no longer supplies the file. | Record that and move on. |
| `403 chat_not_granted` | The media belongs to a chat outside your grant. | Do not retry. |
| `429 rate_limited` | More than 4 uncached downloads are running for your token. | Queue, and retry after `Retry-After`. |

Fetch lazily, and only the kinds you use (`kind` in the
[media object](events.md#media-object)). Photos in a busy channel add up.

---

## A complete WebSocket consumer

Node 22 and TypeScript, with one dependency (`ws`). It stores its cursor in a file, resumes
with `since`, reconnects with backoff, treats `01:30` of silence as a dead connection,
deduplicates on `seq`, and stops when reconnecting cannot succeed. It reads `TGW_TOKEN` from
the environment; `TGW_URL` and `TGW_CURSOR_FILE` are optional.

```ts
// consumer.ts — run with: pnpm add ws @types/ws && pnpm dlx tsx consumer.ts
import WebSocket from "ws";
import { readFile, writeFile, rename } from "node:fs/promises";

const BASE = process.env.TGW_URL ?? "http://127.0.0.1:41414";
const TOKEN = process.env.TGW_TOKEN ?? (() => { throw new Error("TGW_TOKEN is required"); })();
const CURSOR_FILE = process.env.TGW_CURSOR_FILE ?? "./tgw.cursor";
const DEAD_AFTER_MS = 90_000; // 01:30 without any frame

// Close codes after which reconnecting cannot succeed (docs/api.md, "Close codes").
const STOP_CODES: Record<number, string> = {
  4400: "the query string is invalid",
  4401: "the token is missing, invalid or revoked",
  4403: "the grant has neither messages:read nor chats:read",
  4409: "too many connections for this token",
  4499: "the grant was revoked",

  }

main().catch((err) => { console.error(err); process.exit(1); });
```

Two things it leaves to you:

- Call `GET /v1/me` at start and after each `monitoring.*` event, to know which chats you
  currently cover.
- Handle `SIGTERM` by letting the handler in progress finish before exiting. A hard kill is
  still safe, because the cursor is written only after a handler completes, so the event is
  replayed.

## Checklist

Your integration is correct when:

- [ ] It requests only the scopes it uses, with a description the user can understand.
- [ ] It stores the token and the webhook secret the instant it sees `status: "approved"`.
- [ ] It reads `grant.effective_chat_ids` and `grant.scopes` from the gateway instead of
      assuming it got what it asked for.
- [ ] It stores the last processed `seq` after processing, atomically with any side effect
      that is not idempotent, and sends it as `since` when connecting.
- [ ] Killing it at any moment and restarting it loses no event and counts none twice.
- [ ] It ignores any `seq` it has already processed, on the WebSocket and on the webhook.
- [ ] It treats `01:30` without a frame as a dead connection and reconnects with backoff
      and jitter.
- [ ] It stops and alerts a person on close codes `4499` and `4401` and on
      `401 token_revoked`.
- [ ] It handles `history_pruned` by moving its cursor to `oldest_seq - 1`, and backfills
      from history if the gap matters.
- [ ] Its webhook endpoint verifies `X-TGW-Signature` over the raw body with a constant-time
      comparison, answers `2xx` within 10s, and is idempotent per `seq`.
- [ ] It ignores unknown fields, unknown event types and unknown enumeration values.
- [ ] It compares ids as strings and never parses them as numbers.
- [ ] It treats entity offsets as UTF-16 code units.
- [ ] Its history backfill is keyed by `(chat_id, message.id)` and merges with live events.
- [ ] It fetches each `media_id` at most once, and handles `202` and `410`.
- [ ] It calls `GET /v1/me` again after `monitoring.started` and `monitoring.stopped`, and
      backfills a newly covered chat if it needs the past.
- [ ] Nothing it logs contains the token or the webhook secret.
